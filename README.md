# VR Playground

A WebXR-based Virtual Reality playground project created as a hobby to explore and test VR development concepts.

## Overview

This project is a testing development playground for experimenting with WebXR and Three.js to create immersive VR experiences. It's designed as a hobby project to learn and explore VR development techniques.

## Features

- WebXR integration for modern VR headsets (Quest 3, Valve Index, etc.)
- Low-poly art style for efficient rendering
- Procedurally generated environment with trees, terrain, and sky
- Day-night cycle with dynamic lighting
- VR controller interactions
- Ambient audio with spatial sound effects
- Performance monitoring with FPS counter

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses WebXR for VR device integration
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Procedural generation for terrain and trees
- Custom shaders for sky and lighting effects

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open the application in a WebXR-compatible browser
5. Connect your VR headset and enter VR mode

## Controls

- Use VR controllers to interact with the environment
- Controller joysticks for movement
- Trigger buttons for selection
- For desktop testing, use WASD keys for movement

## Performance Considerations

This project includes an FPS counter to monitor performance. For optimal VR experience, the application targets 90 FPS on modern VR headsets.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced terrain generation
- More interactive elements
- Physics-based interactions
- Multiplayer capabilities
- Additional environmental effects

## Disclaimer

This is a hobby project created for learning and experimentation purposes. It's not intended for commercial use.
